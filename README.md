This is a simple NES 6502  project that consists of generating a rom which simply displays the character ralsei from deltarune.
It is my first introduction to 6502 assembly.

The attribute tables were generated by [the clojrue script](https://github.com/figurantpp/ralsei-gen).

I should be sleeping by now.
